The run_lag.m file runs the code with communication lag as a random variable with specified by min_lag and max_lag parameters and is modelled using Probabilistic Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles 
The run_normal file runs the code with communication lag as a random variable with specified by min_lag and max_lag parameters without modelling the noise
